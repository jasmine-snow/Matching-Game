### Key Features
  * Match that animal is a simple matching game designed to help children learn their animals
  * Page will shuffle when loaded and you will win the game once you have chosen all of your cards 
  
### Why I chose a matching game?
  * I chose to build a matching game because I wanted to build a game that would be beneficial to children.  
  
### Technologies Used?
  * The functionality I used for my game included:  
  *An array of objects to store the names, front-image and back-image of the card 
  *Used a simple sort Method to shuffle the cards unpon loading the page
  *Due to the object of arrays I had to separate each item by giving them unique_id's
  *Since the names, front-image, and back-image were in individual objects, I needed two loops 
  *that would individually assign each name an '0' & an '1' example: cat0 & cat1
